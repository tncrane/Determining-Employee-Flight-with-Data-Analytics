Why are Employees Leaving Salifort Motors? 

In order to complete the second level of data analytics with Coursera and Google learning, I had to consider and determine the causes of employee flight for a case company using a medium-sized dataset (15,000 entries). In the Python document, you will find data analytics 
techniques such as basic EDA (head and describe functions for example), as well as more intermediate applications of Python such as data visualizations with the Seaborn and Matplotlib packages. Most excitingly, the data used to create a predictive model using ensemble
learning and XG Boost. These in turn strengthen the model by creating many individual calculations on large portions of the dataset, which prevents bias, overfitting, and other common predictive model issues. Using this fascinating model, I was able to provide insight 
into what factors in the workplace environment were most causing employees to leave the company, which would save the company money in the long term. 

The file AdvDataAnalyticsCapstone has the Python coding performed in this project. The first item is the bulk of the project, and each data visualization is also listed as a separate item.
